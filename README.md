# ImageCompression
Using PCA, K-means Clustering and maybe another algorithm in Colab

Image compression is not only for image compression, but also a method helping us find the major components in a data set.

It can be features selected from current features, or a different, transformed set of features (but less).  It will not only simplify the situation (to fewer features) but also reduce memory/CPU loads and speed up training process.

My plan is to use PCA and K-means Clustering to start with and then explore other methods.  In next few weeks, I will try to explore different aspect of this work.
