# ImageCompression

Using PCA, K-means Clustering and maybe another algorithm in Jupyter.  Original picture is in Resources folder.  Compressed one is in each python scripts folder.

Why doing this?
Image compression is not only for image compression, but also a method helping us find the major components in a data set.

This technique can be used for exploratory data analayis, and also for segmentation and positioning in marketing.

It can be features selected from current features, or a different, transformed set of features (but less).  It will not only simplify the situation (to fewer features) but also reduce memory/CPU loads and speed up training process.

My plan is to use PCA and K-means Clustering to start with and then explore other methods.  In next few weeks, I will try to explore different aspect of this work.
